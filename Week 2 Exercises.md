 week 2
Task 1

1. **"Not Secure" Cautioning in the Main Picture**:
   - Assuming I experience the "Not Secure" cautioning in the primary picture, I will be wary about visiting the site. This cautioning regularly seems when the site needs appropriate encryption, and it implies potential dangers like information interference. To relieve these dangers, I will try not to enter delicate data and reevaluate my choice to utilize the site.

2. **"Trusted" Site in the Second Picture**:
   - On the off chance that a site shows up as "trusted" in the subsequent picture, I will have good expectations about its security. This assignment recommends that the site has a substantial SSL/TLS declaration, guaranteeing scrambled associations. I would continue with utilizing the site, realizing that my information is better safeguarded against block attempt.

3. **Other Techniques to Distinguish Phishing/Trick Sites**:
   - If I have any desire to distinguish phishing or trick locales, I will:
     - Examine the URL for any grammatical mistakes or surprising characters.
     - Check the site's possession and search for contact data.
     - Use program augmentations or online instruments to really take a look at the website's standing.
     - Remain informed about normal phishing methods and digital dangers to all the more likely perceive possible dangers.

4. **Typosquatting and Its Significance to the Pictures**:
   - Assuming I go over typosquatting, I will be wary. Typosquatting includes misleading area names that exploit typographical blunders. With regards to the gave pictures, it could lead clients to fake locales that could set off the "Not Secure" cautioning because of lacking safety efforts. I will twofold really look at the URL for exactness to try not to fall into this snare.

5. **UDRP and Battling Typosquatting**:
   - Assuming I were managing typosquatting issues, I would consider utilizing the Uniform Area Name Question Goal Strategy (UDRP). UDRP permits brand name holders to challenge areas that encroach on their privileges. By recording a UDRP grievance, I might actually deal with or eliminate the encroaching space, safeguarding my image and clients.

6. **Monitoring Areas for Phishing Attempts**:
   - In the event that I possessed the space ouspg.org and worked a crypto banking application at bank.ouspg.org, I would screen different spaces to distinguish conceivable phishing endeavors. These would include:
     - Spaces with slight varieties or grammatical mistakes of my own, for example, ouspg.com or bankouspg.org.
     - Destinations that sound comparable or copy my image.
     - Spaces with various high level areas (TLDs), like .net or .co.
   - To support observing, I could utilize online apparatuses or administrations to get cautions about expected dangers, assisting me with shielding my clients from phishing tricks.

Task 2

**Questions: Payments**

1.  **Why do modern payment cards use a chip and not a magnetic stripe?**
   - Current installment cards utilize a chip since it offers upgraded security contrasted with attractive stripes. Chips produce special exchange codes for each buy, making it hard for fraudsters to clone cards. Attractive stripes, then again, store static information that can be effortlessly duplicated and utilized for unapproved exchanges.

2. **What are EMV Certificates and why are they relevant for payment protection?**
   - EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) testaments are cryptographic declarations utilized in chip-empowered installment cards to validate the card and the terminal during an exchange. They are significant for installment assurance since they assist with guaranteeing that both the card and the installment terminal are veritable, decreasing the gamble of card cloning and fake exchanges.

3. **What attacks exist against payment cards?**
   - There are a few assaults against installment cards:
     - **Card-not-present (CNP)**: These assaults happen in on the web or distant exchanges where the actual card is absent. Fraudsters might utilize taken card subtleties for unapproved buys.
     - **Contactless payment**: Aggressors can utilize gadgets to skim information from contactless cards in the event that the cards' security highlights are feeble.

**Questions: MFA**

4. **How is multi-factor authentication (MFA) used in banking?**
   - MFA in banking regularly includes utilizing at least two verification elements to confirm a client's personality. This can incorporate something the client knows (e.g., a secret word), something the client has (e.g., a savvy card or token), or something the client is (e.g., biometric information like a unique finger impression). MFA improves security by requiring various evidences of character.

5. **How does multi-factor authentication increase payment security?**
   - MFA increments installment security by adding an additional layer of assurance. It guarantees that regardless of whether a fraudster gets a client's secret key or card subtleties, they would in any case require admittance to the extra validation factor, making it more moving for unapproved exchanges to happen.

6. **What MFA methods are you using in you daily life??**
   - In my everyday existence, I could utilize different MFA strategies, for example,
     - Two-factor verification (2FA) by means of instant messages or authenticator applications for online records.
     - Biometric confirmation, similar to unique finger impression or face acknowledgment, on my cell phone.
     - Brilliant cards or tokens for getting to get frameworks at work or for web based banking.

7. **What attacks exists against different forms of 2FA?**
   - Assaults against various types of 2FA include:
     - **Time sensitive one-time passwords (TOTP)**: Assailants might catch or phish the produced codes during login.
     - **Instant message (SMS)**: SIM trading assaults, where an aggressor assumes command over a client's telephone number, can be utilized to block SMS-based 2FA codes.

Task 3: Card Fraud- An essay explaining the card exploitation stories.


**Development of Card Extortion: 10 years of Changing Landscapes**

Card extortion has developed fundamentally throughout the last ten years, driven by mechanical progressions, changing exchange scenes, and moving worldwide patterns. This rundown digs into the multi-layered universe of card extortion, featuring key patterns, sorts of misrepresentation, geological varieties, and the effect of innovation and guidelines somewhere in the range of 2008 and 2019.

**Sorts of Card Fraud**:

Card misrepresentation incorporates different strategies, including:

1. **Card-Present Fraud**: Includes the utilization of actual installment cards in fake exchanges, frequently through card cloning or skimming gadgets at ATMs or retail location (POS) terminals.

2. **Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud**: Happens in on the web or distant exchanges, where the card isn't actually present. Fraudsters utilize taken card subtleties for unapproved buys.

3. **Account Takeover (ATO)**: Includes unapproved admittance to a cardholder's record, normally through phishing assaults or qualification stuffing, permitting aggressors to make exchanges for the casualty's benefit.

4. **Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud**: Happens in on the web or far off exchanges, where the card isn't truly present. Fraudsters utilize taken card subtleties for unapproved buys.

**Topographical Variations**:

The commonness of card misrepresentation types differs geologically because of elements like reception of secure advances, administrative measures, and financial circumstances. Created nations frequently experience higher paces of CNP misrepresentation because of their high level internet business markets, while arising economies might confront more card-present extortion because of lower innovation reception.

**Changes in the Misrepresentation Scene (2008-2019)**:

The misrepresentation scene went through tremendous changes somewhere in the range of 2008 and 2019, driven by a few elements:

1. **Shift to EMV (Chip-and-PIN)**: Numerous nations changed to EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) chip innovation, making card-present extortion more testing as it diminished card cloning.

2. **Rise in CNP Fraud**: As EMV innovation further developed card-present security, fraudsters moved concentration to CNP misrepresentation, focusing on web-based exchanges. The comfort of web based shopping added to the increment.

3. **Mobile Installments and Contactless**: The reception of portable installment applications and contactless card innovation presented new roads for misrepresentation, including versatile application takes advantage of and contactless card skimming.

4. **Data Breaches**: High-profile information breaks uncovered immense measures of touchy cardholder information, filling account takeover and CNP extortion.

**Striking Expansion in Record Takeover (ATO)**:

Account takeover saw a prominent increment throughout the past 10 years because of the ascent in information breaks. Cybercriminals utilized taken certifications to acquire unapproved admittance to accounts, conveying it a critical intimidation to cardholders and monetary foundations.

**Effect of Innovation and Regulations**:

A few innovations and guidelines influenced card misrepresentation:

1. **EMV Adoption**: The boundless reception of EMV chip innovation made it more hard to clone cards, lessening card-present extortion.

2. **Tokenization**: Installment card tokenization improved security by supplanting card subtleties with novel tokens for exchanges, making it provoking for aggressors to think twice about information.

3. **Strong Client Confirmation (SCA)**: Guidelines like the EU's PSD2 ordered SCA for online exchanges, further reinforcing security by requiring different verification factors.

4. **Machine Learning and AI**: High level extortion location frameworks, fueled by AI and man-made reasoning, worked on the capacity to recognize fake examples.

**Changing Exchange Landscape**:

The exchange scene went through critical movements:

1. **E-business Boom**: Internet shopping flooded, prompting expanded CNP exchanges.

2. **Contactless Payments**: Contactless installments acquired prevalence, offering accommodation yet additionally presenting new extortion chances.

3. **Mobile Payments**: The expansion of versatile installment applications prompted a change in installment conduct, with additional exchanges directed through cell phones.

**Web and Web based business' Effect on Card Fraud**:

The web and online business upset shopping, making it advantageous yet in addition powerless to extortion. The namelessness and simplicity of online exchanges pulled in fraudsters. Be that as it may, secure advancements like tokenization and SCA have further developed online business security.

**Significance of Forestalling Information Breaches**:

Forestalling information breaks is urgent in diminishing card extortion. Breaks uncover cardholder information that can be utilized for different deceitful exercises, including CNP misrepresentation and ATO assaults. Carrying out strong information safety efforts is fundamental in impeding these dangers.

**Installment Card Tokenization's Role**:

Installment card tokenization plays had a crucial impact in upgrading security. By supplanting card subtleties with interesting tokens for exchanges, it decreases the gamble of cardholder information openness. Regardless of whether tokens are caught, they are pointless without the relating tokens.

In outline, the development of card extortion somewhere in the range of 2008 and 2019 was set apart by a shift from card-present to card-not-present misrepresentation, driven by mechanical headways and changing exchange ways of behaving. While EMV reception decreased card-present misrepresentation, CNP and ATO assaults turned out to be more predominant. Administrative measures, innovation developments like tokenization, and the significance of forestalling information breaks have been critical in fighting these advancing card extortion dangers.

Task 2: Figure out which subdomain of the application is vulnerable to takeover

How did you figure out the domain?
How can you find out the hosting provider after finding out the domain?


Task 3: Taking over the domain

Now that you found the target domain and the hosting provider, make an assumption that the subdomain was running in the app engine of the provider. We will be simulating a small cloud provider which handles their ipv4 allocation by simply provisioning them via roundrobin for any servers joining their app platform.

Visit the imaginary cloud provider management portal at http://hosting-provider.org.localhost:8080/servers/docs
Try out the functionality of the API portal and try to get the IP of the target subdomain under your control
You can see this by monitoring the target subdomain for a change in response
In this case the IP range is very small, and you can perform this task manually. However, in any real scenario the pool of ip addresses would be big enough to warrant automation. Create a script to automatically provision servers until you get the desired domain by utilizing the underlying API of the management portal:


Task 4: Hijacking data

Your task is to create an application that collects users that log in to the application and hijacks their session if they navigate to your subdomain page.

If you have trouble receiving the login callback data from the banking application, familiarize yourself with CORS and make required adjustments.

Test your application by creating another user in the banking application and by navigating to your site. You should be able to transfer all their money to your account. You should also be able to receive callbacks from the banking application when users log in.

Place your code in the create_your_server.py file.

Hints
To finish off run docker compose down -v to delete any residual volumes.
